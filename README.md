# Bidirectional-Visitor-Counter-System
 using IR sensor and 8051 microcontroller.
This is a low-cost microcontroller based visitor counter that can be used to know the count of number of visitors entering a region. For implementing the counter 8051 microcontroller and 2 IR sensors were used.

Tools that were being used are:

Keil Compiler: for writing the code and generating the output hex file.
Proteus: for simulation of the circuit and verifying the functionality of the code.
